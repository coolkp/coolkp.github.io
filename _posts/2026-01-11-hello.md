Welcome! I'm starting this blog to share insights from my work optimizing ML systems at scale.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- **TPU/GPU performance optimization** - profiling, bottleneck analysis, and practical tips
- **Diffusion model training** - scaling techniques and infrastructure patterns
- **ML infrastructure** - building robust systems for production workloads

## A Quick Example with Mermaid

One thing I love about this blog setup is native Mermaid diagram support. Here's a simple view of a typical ML training pipeline:

<div class="mermaid">
graph LR
    A[Data Pipeline] --> B[Preprocessing]
    B --> C[TPU Training]
    C --> D[Checkpointing]
    D --> E[Evaluation]
    E --> F{Metrics OK?}
    F -->|Yes| G[Export Model]
    F -->|No| C
</div>

And here's how distributed training typically flows across devices:

<div class="mermaid">
flowchart TB
    subgraph Host["Host Machine"]
        Data[Data Loader]
    end

    subgraph TPU["TPU Pod"]
        Core1[Core 1]
        Core2[Core 2]
        Core3[Core 3]
        Core4[Core 4]
    end

    Data --> Core1
    Data --> Core2
    Data --> Core3
    Data --> Core4

    Core1 <--> Core2
    Core2 <--> Core3
    Core3 <--> Core4
    Core4 <--> Core1
</div>

## Writing Posts

Adding a new post is simple - just create a markdown file in the `_posts` folder with the format `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`. Add your front matter at the top:

```yaml
---
layout: post
title: "Your Post Title"
date: 2026-01-15
description: "Optional description for previews"
---
```

Then write your content in markdown. Code blocks, images, and Mermaid diagrams all work out of the box.

More posts coming soon!
