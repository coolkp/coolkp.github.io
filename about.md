I'm a Machine Learning Engineer at Google Cloud, based in Seattle. I focus on optimizing training and inference for Diffusion models at scale on XLA devices (TPUs/GPUs).

## What I Work On

- **TPU/GPU Optimization**: Making large-scale ML workloads run faster and more efficiently
- **Diffusion Models**: Optimizing training and inference pipelines for generative AI
- **ML Infrastructure**: Building systems that scale across thousands of accelerators

## Background

I graduated from UCLA (2015-2019) and have been working on ML systems ever since. My work involves bridging the gap between research models and production-ready systems.

## Open Source

I contribute to several projects including:

- [maxdiffusion](https://github.com/coolkp/maxdiffusion) - Diffusion model optimization
- [vllm](https://github.com/coolkp/vllm) - LLM inference optimization
- [ai-on-gke](https://github.com/coolkp/ai-on-gke) - AI platforms on Google Kubernetes Engine
